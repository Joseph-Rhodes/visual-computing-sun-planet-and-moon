# Solar System Simulation - COMP27112 Lab 2

## Overview
This project is a **solar system simulation** built using **Three.js**. The simulation renders a simple solar system with:
- A **sun** as the central star.
- A **planet (Earth)** orbiting the sun.
- A **moon** orbiting the planet.

The system demonstrates **realistic orbital motion**, **lighting effects**, and **optional enhancements** like textures, rotation, and background stars.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation, simply open the HTML file in a **web browser**.

### Running the Project
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Observe the sun, planet, and moon **moving in orbits**.
3. Use **mouse controls** to rotate and zoom into the scene (if OrbitControls are enabled).

## Features
- 🌞 **Sun**: Emits light and acts as the center of the system.
- 🌍 **Planet (Earth)**: Moves in an elliptical orbit around the sun.
- 🌕 **Moon**: Orbits around the Earth.
- 💡 **Lighting**: Uses **PointLight** for the sun and **AmbientLight** for soft background illumination.
- 🎥 **Camera Controls**: Allows users to zoom, rotate, and explore the scene interactively.
- 🎨 **Textures**: Optional textures can be applied for a more realistic appearance.
- 🌌 **Background Stars**: A large textured sphere represents the Milky Way.

## Enhancements
- **Rotating Sun, Earth, and Moon**: Add rotation for realistic day/night cycles.
- **Cloud Layer**: A separate sphere with transparent cloud textures rotating around the Earth.
- **Starfield Background**: Enhances realism by placing the scene inside a starry sky.
